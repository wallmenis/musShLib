# musShLib
-----------------------------------------------
A music session sharing library based on WebRTC.

### Note:
No actual music transfer for copyright reasons.

-----------------------------------------------

## Usage:
Just drag and include the source files in your project.

## Dependencies:
- [`libdatachannel`](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libdatachannel)
- [`nlohmann_json`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

You may install them with your favorite package manager.
Personally, I use Fedora linux and used 
```
sudo dnf install libdatachannel-devel json-devel
```

If you want, you may help with the project by showing me how to compile with those
libraries from source. Docs are incomming!
